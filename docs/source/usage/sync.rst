sync
======

.. code-block:: bash

    Sync will make sure that your current directory and dependencies are on the same branch.

    If they are, nothing will be updated.
    If your branches are out of sync, you will have a few options to resolve:
        1. Resolve the differences in your GitDepend config files.
        2. Assume config is correct, and switch to that branch.
        3. Abort and take care of it yourself.
